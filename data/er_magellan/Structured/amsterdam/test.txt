It is located in the municipality of Amsterdam, on the northern border of the IJ. In order to stop the land loss caused by the Zuiderzee (a sea), farmers started around 1200 with the building of De Waterlandse Zeedijk. On this dike the village Schellingwoude was founded. That’s why the living room and kitchen are below streetlevel (ánd far below sea-level…). So the history of our street goes back to the 11th century.

This former industrial plot, also known as De Ceuvel, has been converted into one of the most unique and sustainable urban developments in Europe. The outcome is truly mind-blowing. Old houseboats have been hoisted on land and the jetty connecting the vessels isn’t hanging over water but over a green ocean of soil-cleaning plants. Each boat houses creative and social startups or artists showing a true entrepreneurial and sustainable spirit. While the jetty offers some seriously great spots to unwind, café De Ceuvel attracts the biggest crowds. On hot summer days (yes, we do have those) the terrace transforms into a lively festival-like wharf making it hard to believe the city center is just a 5-minute bike ride away. On the edge of the terrace you’ll find our private pier leading to the remains of the piled fendering and the boat lifts that were designed and constructed in the 1 COL host_id VAL 152013045 COL host_name VAL Asile Flottant COL neighbourhood VAL Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands COL neighbourhood_cleansed VAL Oud-Noord COL neighbourhood_group_cleansed VAL nan COL latitude VAL 52.39362 COL longitude VAL 4.91033 COL property_type VAL Boat COL room_type VAL Entire home/apt COL accommodates VAL 2 COL bathrooms VAL nan COL bathrooms_text VAL 1 bath COL bedrooms VAL 1.0 COL beds VAL 1.0 COL price VAL $243.00 	0

COL name VAL Bright, Colourful and Comfortable home COL description VAL Welcome to our charming house in the quiet and charming Amsterdam Noord area!<br /><br />Looking for a quiet, romantic and private place to stay in a lovely garden near to the centre of Amsterdam? You just found it!<br /><br />It's the best of two worlds. With the public transport you will reach the Amsterdam Central station in about 15 minutes. On the other side there is " landelijk Noord",  here you will find several small old villages (Landsmeer, Oostzaan, Waterland and more..) and  lots of nature ('tTwiske).<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />After a day hustle and bustle in the centre you will enjoy our charming house in the calm area with a beautiful green garden full with flowers in the summer. No city noises and exhaust fumes, but singing birds and the smell of flowers!<br /><br />Our house has a spacious and bright livingroom, a fully equipped kitchen,  two bedrooms (one on the first floor and one the top floor)  and a lovely green garden to chill in after a day of Amsterdam.<br COL neighborhood_overview VAL Our neighbourhood has an exceptional village feel. The canal that connects to the countryside to the North add to the typical North-Holland ambiance. Nature reserves Twiske and Ilperveld, as well as Waterland and world-famous Zaanse Schans, are just around the corner. On the other hand, you can reach the center of Amsterdam in 20 minutes, either by bus or on your rental bicycle (riding the free ferry over the IJ just adds to the joy of living in Noord). But you don't even have to go to the city center; Amsterdam Noord is quite upcoming and has a lot of nice restaurants and the well known 'Adam' tower, the Eye theater etc. COL host_id VAL 14161033 COL host_name VAL Jose COL neighbourhood VAL Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands COL neighbourhood_cleansed VAL Noord-West COL neighbourhood_group_cleansed VAL nan COL latitude VAL 52.41924 COL longitude VAL 4.90532 COL property_type VAL Entire house COL room_type VAL Entire home/apt COL accommodates VAL 4 COL bathrooms VAL nan COL bathrooms_text VAL 1.5 baths COL bedrooms VAL 2.0 COL beds VAL 2.0 COL price VAL $140.00 	COL name VAL Cozy appartement Amsterdam Sloterdijk COL description VAL Nice, cozy and clean appartement in Amsterdam West.

As can be expected of an area that is centred on the nation’s most famous outdoor market: Albert Cuypmarkt, near to the Heineken brewery. This Amsterdam neighbourhood is famously diverse with over 100 nationalities represented. While still the best neighbourhood to choose from a wide selection of ethnic food, more high-end bars and restaurants have come on the scene to service students and young professionals. Further east along De Pijp there is the Van Woustraat, a former fast food strip, there are now several of the city’s more highly regarded restaurants. But perhaps most representative of the area is Bazar, a former church on the Albert Cuypmarkt that has been reinvented as a funky North African café/restaurant.
