It cuts the city in two, diagonally from west to east (by Barcelona's compass), hence the name.<br /><br />It was originally projected by engineer and urban planner Ildefons Cerdà as one of the city's wide avenues, which along with Avinguda Meridiana would cut the rationalist grid he designed for l'Eixample (Catalan for extension). Both would meet at Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes, which Cerdà envisioned as the new city centre. However, Plaça Catalunya, equally a new addition to the city of Barcelona, and connecting Ciutat Vella and Eixample, and therefore occupying a more privileged position in the urban area, would finally become the centre. Avinguda Diagonal remains to this day a much-transited avenue and many companies and hotels use it as a privileged location, as can be seen in its architecture.<br /><br />The avenue starts in the Les Corts district on the wes COL host_id VAL 3972936 COL host_name VAL Willem COL neighbourhood VAL Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain COL neighbourhood_cleansed VAL l'Antiga Esquerra de l'Eixample COL neighbourhood_group_cleansed VAL Eixample COL latitude VAL 41.39488 COL longitude VAL 2.15395 COL property_type VAL Entire apartment COL room_type VAL Entire home/apt COL accommodates VAL 8 COL bathrooms VAL nan COL bathrooms_text VAL 2 baths COL bedrooms VAL 4.0 COL beds VAL 6.0 COL price VAL $145.00 	COL name VAL Barcelona Princess COL description VAL nan COL neighborhood_overview VAL nan COL host_id VAL 270236813 COL host_name VAL Hotel Barcelona Princess COL neighbourhood VAL nan COL neighbourhood_cleansed VAL Diagonal Mar i el Front Marítim del Poblenou COL neighbourhood_group_cleansed VAL Sant Martí COL latitude VAL 41.41084 COL longitude VAL 2.21868 COL property_type VAL Room in hotel COL room_type VAL Hotel room COL accommodates VAL 2 COL bathrooms VAL nan COL bathrooms_text VAL nan COL bedrooms VAL nan COL beds VAL nan COL price VAL $0.00 	0

It nestles between the Coll and Putxet hills. Vallcarca was formerly used as a summer holiday residence where families came to find peace and escape from the bustling city. Summer houses were built at the bottom of the hills, alongside the farmsteads of the peasants in the many crop fields in the area. A landscape that still amazes visitors as they look at the hills and see they are dotted with tiny houses built with a certain degree of haphazardness. <br />Crossing the viaduct is quite an experience, because it offers one of the most impressive views of Barcelona and the sea, since the Vallcarca i els Penitents neighbourhood is one of the highest points of the city. <br />  COL host_id VAL 135791982 COL host_name VAL Apartments2be COL neighbourhood VAL Barcelona, Spain COL neighbourhood_cleansed VAL el Putxet i el Farró COL neighbourhood_group_cleansed VAL Sarrià-Sant Gervasi COL latitude VAL 41.41297 COL longitude VAL 2.13823 COL property_type VAL Entire apartment COL room_type VAL Entire home/apt COL accommodates VAL 7 COL bathrooms VAL nan COL bathrooms_text VAL 2 baths COL bedrooms VAL 4.0 COL beds VAL 7.0 COL price VAL $103.00 	COL name VAL Nice flat near La Rambla and Drassanes COL description VAL Nice flat near the emblematic street of Barcelona, La Rambla.
